Remove headers and align texts
==============================

There are two main units of code here.

**removeheaders.py** moves texts from the ```hathidata``` folder to the ```hathiheadless``` folder.

**align_texts.py** aligns the texts in ```hathiheadless``` with the ones in ```gutenclean.``` It outputs the results in the folders ```trimmedguten``` and ```trimmedhathi.```
